# Anonymity Mining

The anonymity mining protocol underpins the [Anonymity Mining Program](../../anonymity-mining.md), which rewards users according to the block duration that they wait before withdrawing their deposits.

Anonymity Mining uses a Tornado Trees contract as a ZK-efficient register of deposit and withdrawal transactions, which enables users to make efficient proofs regarding their usage.
